Class AlgebraicStructure
  Represents Algebraic Structure
  
  name:string - unique name of algebraic structure
  order:int - order of AS (number of elements)
  elements:array - elements of AS
  neutral - neutral element
  table:array of array - Kayley table for AS
  mult(a,b) - computes a*b
  hasElement(elem):bool - indicates whether AS have element elem
  isabelian:bool - indicates whether AS is abelian
  
Class Morphism
  Represents morphism f:A->B
  
  name:string - unique name of Morphism
  from:AlgebraicStructure - algebraic structure A
  to:AlgebraicStructure = algebraic structure B
  mapsize:int - map's element count
  rawmap:array of [a,b] - raw map of morphism
  map(elem) - return value f(elem), undefined if value f(elem) is undefined =)
  
Class Pool
  Represents AS and morphism pool
  
  Pool() - constructor
  morphisms:array of Morphism - morphisms in pool
  structures:array of AlgebraicStructure - algebraic structures in pool
  addStrust(s) - adds AS into pool (for format of agrgument s see sampledata.js), returns undefined if format of s is wrong
  addMorphism(m) - adds morphism into poll (for format of agrgument m see sampledata.js), returns undefined if format of m is wrong
  structure(name) - returns AS with given name if it's exists in pool, otherwise return undefined
  morphims(name) - returns morphism with given name if it's exists in pool, otherwise return undefined
  hasStructure(name) - indicates whether structure with given name exists in pool
  hasMorphism(name) - indicates whether morphism with given name exists in pool
