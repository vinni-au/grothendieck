Class AlgebraicStructure
  Represents Algebraic Structure
  
  name:string - unique name of algebraic structure
  type:strint - type of AS ("group", "monoid")
  order:int - order of AS (number of elements)
  elements:array - elements of AS
  neutral - neutral element
  table:array of array - Kayley table for AS
  mult(a,b) - computes a*b
  inverse(elem) - computes inverse element for given elem
  hasElement(elem):bool - indicates whether AS have element elem
  properties:array of string - properties of AS ("abelian", "cyclic" for group)
  
Class Morphism
  Represents morphism f:A->B
  
  name:string - unique name of Morphism
  from:AlgebraicStructure - algebraic structure A
  to:AlgebraicStructure = algebraic structure B
  mapsize:int - map's element count
  rawmap:array of [a,b] - raw map of morphism
  map(elem) - return value f(elem), undefined if value f(elem) is undefined =)
  
Class Pool
  Represents AS and morphism pool
  
  Pool() - constructor
  morphisms:array of Morphism - morphisms in pool
  structures:array of AlgebraicStructure - algebraic structures in pool
  addStrust(s) - adds AS into pool (for format of agrgument s see sampledata.js), returns undefined if format of s is wrong
  addMorphism(m) - adds morphism into poll (for format of agrgument m see sampledata.js), returns undefined if format of m is wrong
  structure(name) - returns AS with given name if it's exists in pool, otherwise return undefined
  morphims(name) - returns morphism with given name if it's exists in pool, otherwise return undefined
  hasStructure(name) - indicates whether structure with given name exists in pool
  hasMorphism(name) - indicates whether morphism with given name exists in pool
  
Function GenerateRemS(modulo)
  Generates Rem(n)+ group with given modulo
  
Function GenerateEndomorphism(group, indexes)
  Generates endomorphism with given group and indexes. Returns undefined if there's something wrong with indexes
  indexes is array of indexes of elements of group like [0,3,3,2,1]
  
Function GenerateRandomEndomorphism(group)
  Generates random endomorphism with given group
  
Function GenerateRandomMorphism(group1, group2)
  Generates random morphism from group1 to group2
